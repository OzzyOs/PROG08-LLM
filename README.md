What is the "Molukse Koffer" ?
It's an application that is meant to strengthen familial bonds within my Moluccan family, this application is currently being developed with my direct family as the target group.
The hope is that this application can be used to pass on family traditions and values onto the younger generations, this way they can find a way to relate to the struggles or situations of their elders.

There are a few key features that the application will comprise of : 
 1. Store valuable family information, like documents, photos, videos & more.
 2. Gain insight in our direct family tree.
 3. A map feature where users can place markers on locations of their choice, the content of these markers will comprise out of pictures and stories.
